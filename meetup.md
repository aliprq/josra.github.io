## CoDe:er Meet-ups

CoDe:U organize meetings. The meetings are organized in collaboration with the members and the venue switch between meetings, sometimes hosted by one of the members and other times in rented facilities. The idea is that there will be a meeting near you - where ever you are.

Praqma is also hosting short 2 hours seminars almost every month at the office Praqmaplex in Aller√∏d, Denmark. These meeting are typically less formal and take place just after working hours. We serve a cold beer and pizza slices during the meetings. The topics at these short seminars are most often relevant for CoDe:U as well.

If other members would like to host such short, less formal meetups Praqma will support and help organize it.
