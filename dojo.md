## CoDe:er Dojo

### How good is your CoDe:er Kung Fu?

We have introduced this CoDe:er Dojo so that CoDe:ers can practice their skills and keep themselves sharp.

The exercises are based on real life examples and representative for the knowledge domain that CoDe:ers typically operate within.

### Submit your solutions

If you do take these exercises we hope that you will submit your replies, so that we can post them and hopefully inspire others or be the spark that ignites a fruitful discussion.

Before you start here are a few recommendations:

1. Continuous delivery and DevOps is not about correct answers, it's about _best practices_ and _attitude_. Try to make you replies reveal what you are passionate and enthusiastic about.
1. If you'd like to have your replies published and contribute to a debate. Please write your solutions to the exercises in [GitHub flavoured MarkDown][markdown] and mail them to [codeu-editors][codeu-editors].

### Why a dojo?
Originally we came up with the exercises as part of a the preparation for job interviews of applicants for an open position at [Praqma](http://www.praqma.com). The idea of making the dojo came up because some of the people that reviewed the exercises said that they would be fun to publish, and see how people CoDe:er would solve them. Regardless if they were seeking new jobs or not.
