#Joint Open Source Roadmap Alliance

__JOSRA is an alliance that supports the members in feeling safe when they are dependent on Open Source tools in their software development process. By pooling together interests, resources, genuine needs and Open Source experts with lots of good community karma, JOSRA facilitates best practices and joint development on the Open Source tool that is shared among the members.__

As an alliance member you get:

* Support or development cases served by Open Source experts at Praqma - the first two hours spent on every case are included in the membership (limited to 20 cases per year).
* Praqma's leadership and project management on the development of new features and fixes.
* Praqma's leadership, coordination and facilitation of the JOSRA alliance activities and initiatives.
* Ongoing maintenance of the tools in the JOSRA tool stack.
* Access to a yearly 1-day JOSRA alliance meet-up/hackaton where the roadmaps in the JOSRA tools stack are discussed for one year ahead.
* In collaboration with the University of Copenhagen and Copenhagen Business School, Praqma is constantly hosting and tutoring internships for master, bachelor and PA students within computer science. All internship projects will be directed towards generating some kind of benefit to the tools selected by JOSRA either by features, fixes or completely new ideas.

##Being safe - while being dependent on Open Source

Together with our clients we release almost everything we create as Open Source. We have more than 30 Open Source repositories on Github, representing technologies ready to share with others and we are the maintainers of more than 10 plugins on Jenkins CI - all Open Source. When companies use Open Source tools in their tool stack they also need to have a strategy on how to actively make sure that the dependency doesn't turn into a vulnerability. The tools need directions and they need maintenance if they are broken. As a Open Source user you can either be an innovator or a free-rider. A free-rider will simple sit it out and wait for someone else to fix the problem. An innovator will join the community and fix the issue or add the feature himself.

JOSRA enables the members to contribute by proxy, meaning that JOSRA members can take on the role as innovator both through influencing the roadmaps of the tools maintained by the alliance and by exploting the suppor and development cases included in the membership. This influence can be execised without actually having to re-school employees away from the core business domain and into becoming Open Source experts. Praqma has substantial Open Source community karma. This is our business. We'll do it for you.

##The idea behind the concept

The idea behind JOSRA was born from our long experience with developing, hosting, and maintaining an application jointly requested by the 8-10 largest Non Governmental Organizations (NGO's) in Denmark. These NGO's all have that in common, that they are allowed to do house-to-house collections in order to raise capital for their charity work. These NGO's needed an efficient route planner for planning the collection routes for the volunteers. Praqma has developed and for the past six yeas maintained "Rut". The experiences we have gained from joggling demands from many different parties into a shared platform was something that we wanted to utilize to create something similar for Open Source.

Continuous delivery and DevOps as the uniting factors

Continuous Delivery (CoDe) is like a credo for us - DevOps runs in our veins.

Currently the tools in the JOSRA tool stack all have some kind of relation to CoDe and DevOps. It includes:

* Jenkins CI - the world famous automation platform (Open Source Community version)
* Matrix Reloaded Plugin for Jenkins CI (Sony)
* ClearCase UCM plugin for Jenkins CI (Grundfos, Jaguar Land Rover, Novo Nordisk, Syntigo)
* Pretested integration plugin for Jenkins CI (Atmel)
* Config Rotator plugin for Jenkins CI (Grundfos)
* MemoryMap plugin for Jenkins (Yxlon, MAN Diesel & Turbo)
* Logging plugin for Jenkins CI (Praqma)
* PRQA plugin for Jenkins CI (Programming Research)
* Accelerated ClearCase - a set of generic perl triggers (Novo Nordisk, Grundfos, ATP, Siemens)
* COOL - the Clearcase Oriented Open Library (Grundfos, Novo Nordisk)
* ...even a handful more Jenkins CI plugins and pile of other solutions, made available at Praqma's profile on GitHub

As a rule of thumb; Any solution funded by one of the JOSRA alliance member enters into the JOSRA tool stack and will be continuously maintained and developed going forward.

##Yearly meet-ups and online roadmaps

One time every year the JOSRA alliance members are invited to a whole-day meet-up. Each alliance member is entitled and encouraged to send two participants; A geek and a chief. We share experiences and visions and after lunch we split up, so while chiefs plan roadmaps geeks do hackatons - in the evening we eat-up and drink-up together.

Between meetings, all tools in the JOSRA tool stack are being discussed and innovated through different [Trello boards](http://trello.com/josra) made available to all alliance members. More lengthy discussions and general feed-back can be communicated at the "Joint Open Source Roadmap Alliance" [LinkedIn group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/Joint-Open-Source-Roadmap-Alliance-7403229).

##Internships

Praqma is business partner with both the Computer Science Department of University of Copenhagen and Copenhagen Business School. Since we started our company in 2007 we have hosted more than 20 interns and we believe that the best way to teach and challenge these young students is to raise the bar so high that it's just barely within reach. We ask them to setup a continuous delivery pipeline, develop something useful and release it to an open source community. Not seldom does this approach actually lead to a foundation for something that later can be matured into becoming wide spread successes.

The ClearCase UCM plugin for Jenkins CI was first released as a Proof-Of-Concept by two students and today the plugin is used by close to 300 companies.

All the internships that Praqma are hosting and supervising will continue to aim at producing some kind of added value to the tools in the JOSRA tool stack under our guidance. So in the end your alliance fees does not only buy yourself benefits but also supports next-generation programmers to meet real life challenges.

##More meet-ups

Praqma is passionate about facilitating knowledge sharing and organizing meet-ups. We are hosting and coordinate the Jenkins CI community events in Northern Europe, both the conference held at the University of Copenhagen and the Jenkins CU code camp. We run the Continuous Delivery user group [CoDe:U](http://www.codeu.eu/) which gathers several times every year and in October 2014 we will host and coordinate a large Continuous Delivery Conference at Hotel Marriot in the heart of Copenhagen.

As a Josra alliance member you will be offered exclusive benefits to all our events such as VIP passes, discounted admissions, favorable sponsorship packages or opportunities to speak and present.


##Annual JOSRA fee

The annual membership fee - per corporation - is EUR 7,000 and will cover two named persons in each corporation who will be invited to the annual meet-up at no additional cost. During our meet-ups we will strive to reach roadmap decisions by consensus, but in the event that a majority vote is required on a subject, each corporation will be allowed to cast two votes.

Any person representing a member corporation can request membership to the JOSRA trello organization and gain access to the roadmap boards as well as request membership of the JOSRA group on LinkedIn. The membership will be granted by either of the two named persons representing the organization.

NOTE: This is a discounted rate that we will guarantee the first 20 members who join the alliance
