### Exercise - Think of a project
__With the most mature project you ever attended in mind - go and take the [Continuous Delivery Maturity Index test](http://www.praqma.com/cdmi-test). As part of this exercise you should briefly comment on the test, the report and maybe even [the model](http://www.praqma.com/sites/default/files/img/cdmaturity_paper.pdf).__

In this short intro exercise we want you to think of the most mature software project you have participated in so far. It might not be the one you are currently working in so fire up your _way-back-then_ machine.

With that project in mind, go and take the [CMDI](http://www.praqma.com/cdmi-test) test. Register with the same email address you'll use to send in your exercise solutions. The test will automatically mail back the test result and a short report containing high-level recommendations.

Give us your thoughts and feedback on the test and the result.
