### Exercise - Path finder - show us where you are

__Write a short bio of yourself. Share links and stories to who you are and what you do.__

We would like to know what you are passionate about, please tell us - or maybe even _show_ us. Have you left some traces on the grid that can lead us to a better understanding of who you are? What you care about? how you spend your time? Throw us some pointers.

Examples:
 
- Have you ever contributed to an open source community?
- Do you have a blog or are your active in any forums, mail lists, twitter?
- Have you presented anything at conferences, seminars, open space discussions?
- Are you active in a community or organization outside your professional work?
- ...or anything else you would like to draw our attention to.
