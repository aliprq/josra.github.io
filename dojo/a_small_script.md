### Exercise - A small script

__Come up with a script or an application that can scan a PDF file for matching a certain string. The output should be the count of the occurrences of the string within the file__.

In this exercises we need a script or an application that scans a file for the occurrence of a certain string. The ground rules for this exercise are:

 1. You are free to use any programming language that you like.
 1. You are free to implement the solution on any operating system that you like.
 1. You are free to utilize any library features or language extension that you like.
 1. The string to search for shall be case insensitive.
 1. The string to search for shall be given to the script as an option or parameter at execution time.
 1. The PDF file to scan shall also be given to the script as an option or parameter at execution time.
 1. The result shall be printed to STDOUT in the format:
 `<search phrase> = <count of occurences in file>`

Exemplify your solution by scanning the _[Continuous delivery maturity paper](http://www.praqma.com/sites/default/files/img/cdmaturity_paper.pdf)_ for the occurrences of the phrase "continuous delivery".
