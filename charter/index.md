#Josra - Charter

## Name

The name of the alliance is "Joint Open Source Roadmap Alliance". 

Although JOSRA is technically an abbreviation of the alliance's full name, it shall frequently be used as the actual name for the alliance and when used in text it shall be spelled as such with a capital J; _Josra_.

## Purpose and objectives

The purpose of Josra is to offer alliance members, who are dependant on Open Source technologies in their software development tool stacks, an active approach to become _innovators_ as opposed to _free riders_ and jointly and proactively, seek to improve the technologies in question to serve their specific interests.

The objective for Josra is to form a group of companionship, where member companies through mutual trust and a shared wish of collaboration, will strive to seek out common interests and through a focused stake on shared interest in Open Source technologies will be able to gain a higher pace of progress and maturity than the individual company would otherwise have been able to establish single-handedly.

## Success criteria



### Roles

Each Josra member organization will be appointing two persones to represent their membership in the alliance.

* Josra Membership Sponsor (*Chief*)
* Josra Tool Stack Advisor (*Geek*)

Each Josra member organisation is entitled to register more civil members (*Civilans*) who will be granted access to the Josra ressources and communication platforms.

Praqma will be represented by it's group of consultants (*Workers*) as well as project managers and organizers (*Facilitators*).

_The Josra Community_ shall be the term used to refer to the gross group - encompassing _chiefs_, _geeks_, _civilians_, _workers_ and _facilitators_.

## Structure

Josra is an alliance formed and facilitated by [Praqma](http://www.praqma.com).

Membership of the alliance is essentially defined by a _Josra membership contract_ between  Praqma and the individual member organization. The contract describes the conditions and SLA of the working relation under which the delivery of 40 hours of yearly consultancy by Praqma _workers_ and _facilitators_ is to be conducted.

### Members

Members will be listed here as they sign up. 

At this point we have a group of prospects. 

We refer to this group as _The founding Innovators_. It's defined by the group of companies who participated in reviewing the initial versions of the charter and the membership contact.

Members er listed chronically by their proclaimed intention to sign:

* [Yxlon International](http://www.yxlon.com){: target="_blank"}
* [Grundfos](http://www.grundfos.dk){: target="_blank"}
* [Atmel](http://www.atmel.com){: target="_blank"}
* [Volvo IT](http://www.volvoit.com/){: target="_blank"}

## Background and Scope

Praqma comes from a background where we have been facilitating and orchestrating contributions to jointly maintained pieces of software, not only within Open Source technologies but also within proprietary products maintained in a consortium like organization among danish NGOs.

We feel that we've come to a point where we now have so much experience in joggling this  type of collaboration networks, that we want to expand them to cover any Open Source technology desired by the Josra members.

The basis of the collaboration is initially the tool stack that _The Founding Innovators_ has been working on for quite some while together with Praqma - essentially that is made up of 8-10 plugin for Jenkins with a accumulated user base counting hundreds of installations (2000+ as of September 2014).

But the scope is theoretically anything Open Source - as long as it's requested by a membership organization willing to spend ressource to become an innovator in the field, by allocating some of the 40 hours of yearly consultancy by praqma _workers_ which is included in the membership.

## Processes

A typical process for engagement is simply:

1. Members of the Josra community maintains a dialog through cards and comments on the various roadmap trello boards.
1. At some point an issue becomes so pressing for at membership organization that either the _geek_ or the _chief_ raises it to a development case.
1. The issue can be a bug, a feature request, a research request or a request for configuration or adaption. As soon as it's established that the requested work is indeed beneficial to the alliance as a whole, a _worker_ is assigned to the task and an official case is opened in the preferred issue tracking system for that particular Open Source tool.
1. If required, either the _geek_ or an associated _civilian_ will make sure that the _worker_ gets sufficient feed-back and potentially also access to an environment where nature of the issue can be observed, investigated and developed.  
1. When the issue is solved, the solution is deliver to the respective Open Source community and the alliance member can pull it from there.
1. Only when the issue is resolved and closed will the amount of hours spent on the issue be punched out on the 40 hours "punch card" that every alliance members is granted for each membership period (12 months).


### Annual meetup

Once every year in the first quater of the year, Praqma is responsible for organizing a meetup, that shall be open to all Josra community members.

_Geeks_, _chiefs_, _workers_ and _facilitators_ are granted access complimentary to the membership. _Civilians_ are welcome at an additional fee.

The annual meetups shall seek hosting facilities and venues at the membership organizations. 

Expenses for catering, venues etc shall be covered by Praqma.

### Roadmaps

Roadmaps are maintained individually for each tool in the Josra tool stack.

Roadmaps are organized as Trello boards in Josra's organization on [www.trello.com/josra](www.trello.com/josra).
