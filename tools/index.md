Continuous Delivery (CoDe) and DevOps as the uniting factors. Continuous Delivery is like a credo for us - DevOps runs in our veins.

Currently the tools in the JOSRA tool stack all have some kind of relation to CoDe and DevOps. It includes:

* __Jenkins CI__ - the world famous automation platform (Open Source Community version)
* __Matrix Reloaded plugin__ for Jenkins CI (Sony)
* __ClearCase UCM plugin__ for Jenkins CI (Grundfos, Jaguar Land Rover, Novo Nordisk, Syntigo)
* __Pretested integration plugin__ for Jenkins CI (Atmel)
* __Config Rotator plugin__ for Jenkins CI (Grundfos)
* __MemoryMap plugin__ for Jenkins (Yxlon, MAN Diesel & Turbo)
* __Logging plugin__ for Jenkins CI (Praqma)
* __PRQA plugin__ for Jenkins CI (Programming Research)
* __Accelerated ClearCase__ - a set of generic perl triggers (Novo Nordisk, Grundfos, ATP, Siemens)
* __COOL__ - the Clearcase Oriented Open Library (Grundfos, Novo Nordisk)
* ...even a handful more Jenkins CI plugins and pile of other solutions, made available at Praqma's profile on GitHub

As a rule of thumb; Any solution funded by one of the JOSRA alliance member enters into the JOSRA tool stack and will be continuously maintained and developed going forward.
