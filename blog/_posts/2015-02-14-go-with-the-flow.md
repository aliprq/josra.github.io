__Do you recall the great Object oriented method war? Starting in the 1980ies and picking up ammunition in the early 1990'ies OO celebrities like Shlaer+Mellor, Coad, Booch, Rumbaugh, Jacobson all contributed to (deliberatately?) different opinions on the topic *"How do we describe OOA&D?"*__

Back then it seemed so important enough that even details like whether classes should have rounded corners or not became battlefield material.

The great method war ended when Rational Software managed to engage the both Grady Booch and Jim Rumbaugh and later also Ivar Jacobson in bold project that was supposed to create peace in the war by unifying all viewpoints into a common Unified Modeling Language (UML) which should become the de facto standard for all OO freaks throughout the world.

Mission completed!

Today we don't fight over Object Oriented Analysis and Design anymore, we just code. Rational Software is long gone, swallowed by IBM and _The three Amigos_
